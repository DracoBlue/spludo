Demo - Spludo Framework README
=======================

Installation
------------

If you have nodejs already installed, there is nothing else to install.

Your demo folder should look like this:
 demo/
    controllers/
    views/
    modules/
    run_console.js
    run_server.js


Run
---

To run the demo, head into the demo folder and type:
 node run_server.js
This will launch your demo server on port 8000.

If you alternatively want to run it in console mode, type:
 node run_console.js list
This will execute the path "list" on the application and shut down when
it's done.
