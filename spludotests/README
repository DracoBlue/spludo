SpludoTests - Spludo Framework README
=======================

This is the test application for the entire spludo framework.


Running the tests
-----------------

Enter the directory spludotests and execute:
 ant core-test
 
 
Integrating with Continous Integration Tools
--------------------------------------------

The tests also support an option to return .xml format (junit-style) to
integrate with tools like hudson or cruise control.

You may run the tests with the following command to achieve that:
 node ../build/run_tests.js xml
 
Please use that ONLY to retrieve the xml format, because the "ant core-test"
command is way more convenient for the normal test execution.
